## Error Handling & Logging

Every stored procedure includes robust validation and try-catch blocks, logging errors and input parameters to the FailedTransactionLog for future diagnostics and auditing.
Success and failure logs help resolve customer disputes and regulatory investigations efficiently.

## Extensibility

Potential future enhancements include:

REST API layer for integration with UIs/mobile apps.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure privilege management.
Automated audits using database triggers to monitor sensitive changes.
